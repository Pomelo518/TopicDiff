# TopicDiff: A Topic-enriched Diffusion Approach for Multimodal Conversational Emotion Detection
This repo contains the datasets we used and codes for the paper "TopicDiff: A Topic-enriched Diffusion Approach for Multimodal Conversational Emotion Detection" (LREC-COLING 2024).
# Datasets
The datasets we constructed in this paper is released at [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xUNGIQZH2rewUAwjFZSFpDXD7IPdQaGt/view?usp=drive_link).  
To make it easier to use our constructed dataset, we upload the code to load the datasets.
# Codes
We are cleaning up the codes, and we will upload them later. 
# Acknowledgments
We thanks to the contributions of [conv-emotion](https://github.com/declare-lab/conv-emotion) and [ncsn](https://github.com/ermongroup/ncsn). Based on their works, we could be able to TopicDiff.
